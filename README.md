# fsharp-ts-mode

A tree-sitter-based Emacs major mode for [F#](https://fsharp.org) development.

**Requires Emacs 29.1+** with tree-sitter support.

## Installation

### package-vc (Emacs 30+)

```emacs-lisp
(package-vc-install "https://github.com/bbatsov/fsharp-ts-mode")
```

### use-package with package-vc (Emacs 30+)

```emacs-lisp
(use-package fsharp-ts-mode
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/bbatsov/fsharp-ts-mode" :rev :newest))
```

### Manual

Clone the repository and add it to your `load-path`:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/fsharp-ts-mode")
(require 'fsharp-ts-mode)
```

## Grammar Installation

Install the required F# tree-sitter grammars:

```
M-x fsharp-ts-mode-install-grammars
```

This installs both the `fsharp` grammar (for `.fs` and `.fsx` files) and
the `fsharp-signature` grammar (for `.fsi` files) from [ionide/tree-sitter-fsharp](https://github.com/ionide/tree-sitter-fsharp).

## Features

- Syntax highlighting (font-lock) via tree-sitter, organized into 4 levels
- Indentation via tree-sitter
- Imenu support with fully-qualified names
- Navigation (`beginning-of-defun`, `end-of-defun`, `forward-sexp`)
- Compilation error parsing for `dotnet build` output
- Prettify symbols (`->` to `→`, `fun` to `λ`, etc.)
- Eglot integration for the [F# Language Server](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete)
- Switch between `.fs` and `.fsi` files with `C-c C-a`

## Configuration

```emacs-lisp
;; Change indentation offset (default: 4)
(setq fsharp-ts-indent-offset 2)

;; Enable prettify-symbols-mode
(add-hook 'fsharp-ts-mode-hook #'prettify-symbols-mode)
```

### Eglot

`fsharp-ts-mode` works with Eglot out of the box if you have
[FsAutoComplete](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete) installed:

```sh
dotnet tool install -g fsautocomplete
```

Then enable Eglot:

```emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'fsharp-ts-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)
```

## Known Limitations

F# is an indentation-sensitive language -- the tree-sitter grammar needs
correct whitespace to parse the code. This has a few practical consequences:

- **Pasting unindented code**: If you paste a block of F# with all indentation
  stripped, `indent-region` won't fix it because the parser can't make sense of
  the flat structure. Paste code with its indentation intact, or re-indent it
  manually.
- **Script files (.fsx)**: Shebang lines (`#!/usr/bin/env dotnet fsi`) are
  handled automatically. Mixing `let` bindings with bare expressions works,
  though the grammar may occasionally produce unexpected results in complex
  scripts.
- **Incremental editing works well**: When you're writing code line by line, the
  parser has enough context from preceding lines to indent correctly.

See [doc/DESIGN.md](doc/DESIGN.md) for technical details on these limitations
and the overall architecture.

## Keybindings

| Key       | Command              | Description                    |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| `C-c C-a` | `ff-find-other-file` | Switch between `.fs` and `.fsi` |
| `C-c C-c` | `compile`            | Run compilation                |

## Background

This package was inspired by [neocaml](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml), my
tree-sitter-based OCaml mode. After spending time in the OCaml community I got
curious about its .NET cousin and wanted a modern Emacs editing experience for
F# as well. I strongly considered naming this package "Fa Dièse" (French for
F sharp -- because naming things after spending time with OCaml does that to
you), but ultimately chickened out and went with the boring-but-obvious
`fsharp-ts-mode`. Naming is hard!
