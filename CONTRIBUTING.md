# Contributing to fsharp-ts-mode

If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements or new features,
please report them to the [issue tracker][1] of the repository or
submit a pull request. Please, try to follow these guidelines when you
do so.

## Issue reporting

* Check that the issue has not already been reported.
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code
  (a.k.a. `main`).
* Be clear, concise and precise in your description of the problem.
* Open an issue with a descriptive title and a summary in grammatically correct,
  complete sentences.
* Mention your Emacs version and operating system.
* Include any relevant code to the issue summary.

## Pull requests

* Use a topic branch to easily amend a pull request later, if necessary.
* Write [good commit messages][2].
* Mention related tickets in the commit messages (e.g. `[Fix #N] Fix indentation for ...`).
* Update the [changelog][3].
* Use the same coding conventions as the rest of the project.
* Verify your Emacs Lisp code with `checkdoc` (`C-c ? d`).
* [Squash related commits together][4].
* Open a [pull request][5] that relates to *only* one subject with a clear title
  and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.

## Getting started

Install the required `fsharp` and `fsharp-signature` grammars by running
`M-x fsharp-ts-mode-install-grammars`.

## Debugging

Set `fsharp-ts--debug` to get more debug information from TreeSitter:

- `t` -- output indentation debug data and enable `treesit-inspect-mode`
  (shows the current node in the modeline).
- `'font-lock` -- additionally output font-lock debug info (can get very noisy).

```emacs-lisp
;; enable all TreeSitter debug information
(setq fsharp-ts--debug 'font-lock)
```
